This Code Book details the Variables and Observations in the resulting dataset created when run_analysis.R is run:

Variables
1.	Subject – The subject/volunteer on whom the experiment was carried out.

2.	Activity – The type of Activity for which the measurements were captured. There are 6 levels of Activity:
  •	WALKING (value 1)
  •	WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2)
  •	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3)
  •	SITTING (value 4)
  •	STANDING (value 5)
  •	LAYING (value 6)

3.	Features – The mean and standard deviations of various estimates calculated from the measurements captured:
  •	"timeBodyAccMeanX"                    
  •	"timeBodyAccMeanY"
